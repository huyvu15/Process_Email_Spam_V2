[_Read this email in your browser._](      ---      * * *      |  |  Hi ,  |  |   ---      ## Import Data From Web to Excel  We now have a new, improved way to import data from the web to Excel.  Just like [in Power BI]( the Get Data > From Web connector for Power Query in Excel (image below) now auto-detects tables and curates them into a **Suggested Tables** list.  Plus, you can use the AI-driven **Add Tables Using Examples** to show it the data you want to scrape from a web page.    ![Get data from Web](    After entering the URL for the web page, we have a new Navigator where we can choose from:    1. HTML Tables   2. Suggested Tables   3. Tables Using Examples  ![Power Query Navigator showing suggested tables](   _ **Note:** The \"Suggested Tables\" and \"Add table Using Examples\" features are available to Microsoft 365 users._    ![Table of contents]( ai-scraping.png)  |   ---      _Prefer to read this on our website?  _   _Then click this link >>> _[Import Data from Web in Excel](  |   ---      |   ---      ## Video: Import Data from Web to Excel With AI  [![](  [ **Watch on YouTube**]( \"Watch on YouTube\")  |  [ **Subscribe**]( \"Subscribe\")  |   **563K**      ---|---|---          ## Download Example File  Download the Excel file with the examples in this blog post.    |  |  [Download Example Workbook](   ---          |   ---      ## Power Query Get Data from Web Improvements  If you ever tried to extract data from a webpage using [Power Query]( in Excel, where the data was not structured in a tabular format and contained in HTML table tags, you might only get the option to pull out the HTML code which was not much use.  Now, we can use **Suggested Tables** or **Add Table Using Examples** that **leverage AI** to easily import data from the web into Excel.  Enabling you to keep your data updated for any changes made on the source web pages.  And transfer the related M code from Power BI to Excel and vice versa as now both support Web.BrowserContents and Html.Table functions.    ## New - Suggested Tables  Suggested tables are auto-detected Excel tables, that can convert webpage data into a tabular format, even though visibly the webpage might not show any tables.  For example, suppose you are an avid gamer and want to keep track of Xbox game prices to buy them when they are heavily discounted. You can pull that data out using Suggested Tables.    ## How to use Suggested Tables  Browse games on the [Xbox website that are priced between $5 and $10]( > Copy the URL: [ US/browse/games?Price=5To10](      ![browse xbox games](    Open a blank Excel file > Go to Data Tab > Select \"From Web\" under the \"Get & Transform Data\" section.    ![Get Data from Web on Ribbon](    A dialog box will open for you to fill in the URL > Paste the Xbox URL and press ok.      ![enter url to get data from](    In the Navigator menu, select the table you think contains the correct data from the Suggested Tables section.  You can check the data in the preview section to decide.  In this case, Table4 gives the original and the sale price of the games from which you easily see which games have the best discount.    ![choosing table to load](    Sometimes you may need to [transform the data]( to remove any additional data you don't need.    ## Limitations of Suggested Tables  While Suggested Tables is a great enhancement, they do have a few limitations:    * Some web pages don't render any Suggested Tables   * At times Suggested Tables don't have the data you need, or it's not structured the way you want and may require too much transformation   * Suggested Tables don't work well with endlessly scrolling pages or those with the \"Load More\" button.  Some of these limitations can be overcome using the Add Tables Using Examples option.    ## New - Add Tables Using Examples  Suppose you are starting an online store selling gadgets. You want to stock up on inventory based on tech reviews from websites like [CNET]( because you think those products will have the highest demand.  You open a buying guide such as the [Best Flip Phone of 2023]( but you see that the products mentioned are not in a tabular format. Also, the page has a lot of text that you will have to scroll through to find out the best products to add to your store.    ![website with tables and text](    Now Power Query can make this job easier for you!  All you need to do is open the buying guide and train Excel using the \"Add Tables Using Example\" method.    ## How to use Add Tables Using Examples?  Go to the [Best Flip Phone of 2023]( buying guide > Copy the URL: [ phone- of-2023/](  Open a blank Excel file > Go to Data Tab > Select \"From Web\" under the \"Get & Transform Data\" section.    ![From Web in Get and Transform data](    Paste the CNET URL in the From Web dialog box and press ok.    ![Enter URL to get data from](    In the Navigator menu, select the Add Tables Using Examples option.    ![Select Add tables Using Examples](    A new window will appear with two panes, where the top pane is the URL preview, and the bottom pane has a table for you to enter data.      ![URL Preview](    As you type the first few letters, you will start getting suggestions. Pick the right product from the suggestions.  After you give a few examples, Excel will detect a pattern and scroll through the page to pull out similar .      ![Enter examples](    Once the first column is complete, you add two more columns for price and \"best for\" the same way.  And just in minutes, you will have all the products mentioned in a buying guide neatly arranged in an Excel table!  Don't forget to change column names (double click to edit them) > Press Ok    ![Change column names in table](    Once you are back on the Navigator page, a new table will appear under the section Custom Tables. Click on it to load the preview.    ![Load preview of custom table](  You can either load the data as is or transform it to suit your needs.    ## Transforming Data  As you can see, the price column also has the supplier mentioned in it. It would make more sense to split it into separate Price and Supplier columns.  To do this, select Price column > Select Split Column from the Home Tab> Select \"By Delimiter\"    ![split column by delimiter](    In the Split Column by Delimiter window, select a custom delimiter \" at \"  Select Left-Most delimiter to avoid multiple splitting points > Press Ok    ![select left-most delimiter](     _Tip: Ensure that you have spaces before and after the word \"at\" to avoid having extra spaces after splitting the columns._  You will have two columns with price and supplier, rename them accordingly, and check that the data type is correct.      ![rename columns and check data type is correct](  Close and load the table.   _Tip: It's always a good idea to rename your queries for future reference. Here I have renamed it to Flip Phones_    ## Replicating the Query  Once you do this for one buying guide, you can replicate the query for all the buying guides from the same website with the same webpage structure. If you only want to scrape one more page the following steps are the quickest (if you have multiple pages to scrape, see the next section):  Go to the Power Query editor > Right-click on the query > Select Duplicate    ![duplicate query](    Go to the View Tab > Open Advanced Editor > Replace URL    ![Replace URL in the Advanced Editor](    For example, here I replaced the Flip Phones URL with the Cheap Phones URL [ phone/](    ![replaced url](    And without doing anything, I will get a new table with a list of the best cheap phones!      ![new table from duplicated query](    But that's not all! You can also append multiple queries together to create one single comprehensive product list!    ![appending tables](    ![table resulting from appended queries](   _ **Tip:** In case you get a privacy notice, select \"Public\"_    ## Scrape Data from Multiple Pages  Let's say you have a list of pages you want to get data from in a table called **Page_URLs** :    ![list of url's](    Load this table to Power Query using the From Table/Range connector:    ![load table to power query](    Then load one of the pages to Power Query using the From Web connector and Add Table Using Examples we looked at in the previous step. I've called this query **Products**.  Open the Advanced Editor for the web query and add (URL as text) => at the top of the query code and replace the URL in the code with \"&URL&\":    ![convert query to function](    This will convert the query into a custom function that looks like this:    ![custom function in power query](    Go to the **ProductList** query and Add Column tab > Invoke Custom Function:    ![invoke custom function](    Select the query name from the Function query drop down list:    ![select function to invoke](    At the warning, click on **'Edit Credentials'** and choose **Anonymous** :    ![choose anonymouse web access](    Click the double arrow on the Products column:    ![expand tables in column](    I like to deselect 'Use original column name as prefix':    ![do not use original column name as prefix](    Click ok and you should see the results from all pages in one table:    ![results of scraping multiple pages](    Filter out any null rows from the Price column and change the data types on the Transform tab > Detect Data Type:    ![filter null rows](    Check the data types are assigned correctly and you're good to Close & Load.  To get updates to the queries, right click the query > Refresh, or via the Data tab of the ribbon > Refresh All to update all queries in one go.    ## Limitations of Add Tables Using Examples    *  **Page structure:** All source web pages should have a similar page structure if you want to replicate queries or scrape multiple pages.   *  **Complex pages:** If the webpage is too complex, Power Query might not be able to detect patterns leading to inaccurate results.   *  **JavaScript limitation:** Power Query still cannot get data from pages that use JavaScript to load the data on the fly as filters are selected within the web page, without changing the URLs. We saw this with the first example for the Xbox games where there is a button at the bottom of the page to 'load more'. This loads more results to the page, but Power Query cannot see these results.   *  **API Limits:** some websites will limit the number of results returned to manage load on their site. This is not a Power Query limitation, but rather the site owner's choice.   *  **Forbidden Access Limitation:** Some web pages restrict access to their data:  ![access to resource is forbidden](    ## Requirements  Currently, these features are only released for Windows users with Microsoft 365. Microsoft has plans for a Mac release, but there is no timeline for their availability.  Apart from that you also need the following:    * Microsoft Office 365 subscription   * Install the latest Excel update from File > Account > Update Now   * Remember to respect copyright laws and regulations when scraping data from websites    ## Next Steps  Ready to unlock the full potential of Power Query and transform your data handling skills?

This enhancement is set to streamline data interaction and management in Excel, making it more efficient and user-friendly.    ![checkboxes progress demo](   _*Currently available to Microsoft 365 users on the Beta channel._      ![Table of contents]( incell-checkboxes.png)  |   ---      _Prefer to read this on our website?  _   _Then click this link >>> _[Excel In-Cell Checkboxes](  |   ---      |   ---      ## Video: Excel In-Cell Checkboxes  [![](  [ **Watch on YouTube**]( \"Watch on YouTube\")  |  [ **Subscribe**]( \"Subscribe\")  |   **564K**      ---|---|---          ## Download Example File  Download the Excel file with the examples in this blog post.    |  |  [Download Example Workbook](   ---          |   ---      ## Excel Checkboxes in Cells  Checkboxes are a great tool for making selections or indicating choices.  Before these new in-cell checkboxes were released, Excel had [form control checkboxes]( However, these were quite tedious to work with and had their limitations.  To simplify using checkboxes, Excel has now made it possible to insert checkboxes in cells. This creates a more intuitive and integrated spreadsheet experience.  ## Practical Applications  Incell checkboxes have diverse applications, such as simple task lists, enabling and disabling data displayed in charts, and turning on and off conditional formatting to name a few.  Let’s look at some of these applications with some examples.  ### Task Lists  Suppose you are going on a trip and packing seems too daunting a task. Use in- cell checkboxes to make it much simpler for you.  List down everything you need to pack in an Excel sheet. Then use the next two columns to categorize items under “Do I have these?” and “Have I packed these?” categories.    ![Task list](    Now, you have a nice-looking matrix and are ready to insert checkboxes.  Select the cells to insert checkboxes > Go to Insert Tab > Select Checkbox under Cell Controls    ![insert checkbox from Ribbon](    You can even insert a 4th column for Status.    ![add status column ](    These checkboxes have TRUE/FALSE values when checked and unchecked, respectively.  You can create a [nested IF formula]( that tells you what you need to do – i.e. do you need to buy something, pack it, or you have already packed it.                  =IF(D5,\"Packed\",IF(C5,\"Need to pack\", \"Buy\r     New\"))     **Tip** : because the checkbox returns TRUE and FALSE as their status, we don’t need to perform further logical tests, we can simply reference the cell status.  The status column tells you what you need to pack and buy.  This way, you can generate a task list and a buying list at the same time.  For a finishing touch, add [conditional formatting]( to format the font in grey and a strikethrough.  Home tab > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula to determine which cells to format:    ![add conditional formatting rule](    ### Project Management  Similarly, you can use these checkboxes to track the progress of a multi-step production process, such as furniture manufacturing.  You can list down several items and the processes they undergo, and track production progress, by simply combining these in-cell checkboxes using data bars and conditional formatting.    ![using checkboxes for project management](    To do this, you first need to calculate the progress percentage using the below formula:                  =IFERROR(COUNTIF(C3:F3,TRUE)/COUNTA(C3:F3),\"\")    Here COUNTIF adds up the check-marked processes and divides it by the total number of processes, calculated using COUNTA.  Next, insert the [Conditional Formatting data bars](  Select cells G5:G11> Home Tab > Conditional Formatting > Data Bars > Pick any one from Solid or Gradient Fill Data Bars.    ![add conditional formatting data bars](    Here, I have also added the rules that make the font color of the cells change based on progress rate - Green when 100% and Red when < 30%.  You can even add progress-based dynamic remarks and then use those remarks to filter the rows.  For example, here we can categorize the progress into the 3 inventory heads – Raw Material, Work in Progress, and Finished Goods, by using a simple IF and [SWITCH function]( combination:    ![add category for status column](                  =IF([@[Sourced Material]], SWITCH([@Progress], 0.25,\"Raw Materials\", 1,\"Finished Goods\", \"Work in Progress\"),\"Get Raw Materials\")    The IF function assesses whether the “Sourced Material” checkbox is checked or not.  If it is checked, it implies that the manufacturer has the materials. Only after this, the SWITCH function comes into play.  SWITCH function categorizes the inventory into 3 statuses as follows:        **Progress Rate**  |   **Status**  |   **Reason**      ---|---|---       **25% or 0.25**  |  Raw Materials  |  Only “Sourced Material” checkbox is checked       **100% or 1**  |  Finished Goods  |  All 4 checkboxes are checked       **Any other value in between**  |  Work in Progress  |  Some tasks remain to be completed.           However, if Sourced Material is FALSE, the SWITCH function is ignored, and the IF function returns its FALSE value, i.e. “Get Raw Materials”.    ### Dynamic Charts  For a more sophisticated use you can combine these checkboxes with charts to toggle which series to display.    ![checkboxes chart demo](    They can come in very handy in data analysis and interactive dashboards.  The chart displays historical data of 4 US stock market indices from Jan 1, 2019 to September 30, 2023.    ![us stock data](    To set it up:    * Create a new table with the names of the indices and the checkboxes.  ![table to display stock data](    * Create a new data table linked to the original one. However, this table will only display index prices if you have the corresponding checkbox checked.     * Bring the dates in from the source table, copy and paste if you don’t expect it to change, or use a formula as shown below.     * Use XLOOKUP to find the corresponding price of the index on that particular date.     * Multiply the output with the checkbox cell of the corresponding index.  ![calculating data for us stocks](    The formula in column H is:                  =XLOOKUP(G3#,Data[Date],Data[DJI])*$C$4    You will need to adjust the multiplier to the corresponding check box for each index.  Now when you check the checkbox for an index, the new data table will show its prices, but when you uncheck it, the prices will become 0.   **Tip** : if you prefer to hide the line altogether, use IF to return N/A like so:                  =IF(C4, XLOOKUP(G3#,Data[Date],Data[DJI]), NA())                    * Using this new data table, insert a line chart which will also be dynamic, and only display the indices you checkmark.    This functionality is helpful when viewing multiple series in a single chart where those series are significantly different in scale.  For example, DJI and NASDAQ appear to have been more volatile over the period than the S&P 500 and RUT, which appear relatively flat.  However, if you remove DJI and NASDAQ from the chart, you can see that they were also volatile, just on a smaller scale.    ![chart showing DJI and NASDAQ](    ### Filtered Lists  We can team incell checkboxes up with the [FILTER function]( to enable users to select what data they want returned in a table.    ![checkboxes filter demo](    The source data table called ‘Financials’ has some helper columns (H through J) to detect if the checkbox on the sheet called ‘ FILTER’ is selected for the data in the row:    ![helper column in source data](    Then the [VSTACK function]( brings the headers from the Financials source table and joins them to the top of the table returned by the FILTER function;    ![add data from separate table](    See the video above for step-by-step instructions or download the file above.  ## Key Features of the New Checkboxes  The introduction of in-cell checkboxes brings several advantages:   **Simple Insertion** : Easily add checkboxes directly into cells from the `Insert` tab.   **Enhanced Data Integrity** : These checkboxes maintain their position and alignment, even with changes to the spreadsheet layout because they are part of the cell.   **Compatibility with Conditional Formatting** : Leverage Excel's conditional formatting features in conjunction with checkboxes for dynamic data visualization.  ## Limitations    * You can trigger checking the checkbox with a formula, but you can’t also manually check the box.   * Does not auto-fill down in tables   * Deleting a checkbox converts it into a ghosted state that can be brought back when you click on the cell. To remove it completely you must clear all formats via the Home tab.   * If you open the Excel file in a version of Excel that doesn’t support the new checkboxes, the cells will simply display TRUE or FALSE.   * Checkboxes don’t display in data validation or PivotTables, however their TRUE and FALSE values do.  ## Additional Resources  If you don’t have the new in-cell checkboxes, try the [original form control check boxes here](      Have a great day,  Mynda Treacy  Co-founder My Online Training Hub  ![MVP logo]( static.com/MjAxMjk0OA==/original/a88a91cd9c434318aabddd7f7c76cc19.png)    * * *    [![]( rating2.png)](   ---      |   ---      * * *    ## ![]( icon.png)   Learn With Us  | |  ![Excel Dashboards]( email-icon.png)  |  [ _Excel Dashboards_ ![]( icon.png)](      ---|---      ![Power BI]( icon.png)  |  [ _Power BI_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Power Query]( email-icon.png)  |  [_Power Query_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Power Pivot]( email-icon.png)  |  [_Power Pivot & DAX_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Advanced excel]( excel-email-icon.png)  |  [_Advanced Excel_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Advanced Formulas]( formulas-email-icon.png)  |  [_Advanced Formulas_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![VBA](  |  [_Excel Macros & VBA_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Pivot table Quick Start](  |  [_PivotTable Quick Start_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Office Scripts]( scripts-course-email-icon.png)  |  [_Office Scripts to Automate Excel_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Extreme Pivot tables](  |  [_Xtreme PivotTables_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Excel tables]( tables-email-icon.png)  |  [_Excel Tables_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Financial Modelling]( icon.png)  |  [_Financial Modelling in Excel_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Excel  Customer Service]( email-icon.png)  |  [_Excel for Customer Service_ ![]( icon.png)](      ![Excel, Word Outlook]( email-icon.png)  |  [_Excel, Word & Outlook_ ![]( icon.png)](      |   ---      |  |  _This email may contain affiliate links.

You no longer need to research the web and copy over the data into Excel. Simply prompt the AI in natural language, and it will spill out the results for you within Excel! All thanks to the Excel LABS.GENERATIVEAI function.  Using LABS.GENERATIVEAI you can even reference other cells or named formulas in your workbook.     * * *  ### We now have ChatGPT inside an Excel formula!  * * *      ![ChatGPT inside an excel formula](    The image above illustrates the LABS.GENERATIVEAI function returning the airport codes for a list of airports in column J.   _ **Note:** LABS.GENERATIVEAI is available in Microsoft 365 & Office 2021 or later._    ![Table of contents]( labs-genai.png)  |   ---      _Prefer to read this on our website?  _   _Then click this link >>> _[LABS.GENERATIVEAI Function](  |   ---      |   ---      ## Video: LABS.GENERATIVEAI Function  [![](  [ **Watch on YouTube**]( \"Watch on YouTube\")  |  [ **Subscribe**]( \"Subscribe\")  |   **565K**      ---|---|---          ## Download Example File  Download the Excel file with the examples in this blog post.    |  |  [Download Example Workbook](   ---          |   ---      ## LABS.GENERATIVEAI Function Overview  The Excel LABS.GENERATIVEAI function is a custom function created by Excel Labs under Microsoft Garage. It allows you to send prompts directly from your Excel sheet to OpenAI’s generative AI model and quickly get the results you need.  The model analyses the information available to it, processes data, and produces a response based on the prompt you provide.  Overall, it works like a personal assistant that can speed up your spreadsheet creation process, reduce your research, and minimize the formula writing time. Now, you can just focus on the more important aspects of your analysis.  Let’s look at a few examples to understand what all LABS.GENERATIVEAI is capable of!    ## Generating Lists from the Web  The simplest application of LABS.GENERATIVEAI is to pull out standard information from the web, such as state abbreviations, airport codes, or international mobile phone codes.  For example, you need to create a state-wise demographics report of the US and need a list of all the 50 states with their abbreviations.  Instead of copying from the web, you can simply use the LABS.GENERATIVEAI function.    ![Returns the state abbreviation](    To list down all the 50 states, use the below formula:                  =TRANSPOSE(TEXTSPLIT(LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"return a comma separated list of the 50 states in the united states of america with no leading text\"),\",\r     \"))    By default, LABS.GENERATIVEAI renders the output in a single cell. Use TEXTSPLIT to split the comma-separated list and then TRANSPOSE it to return each state in a separate row.  Once you have that, simply reference this column to generate state abbreviations, using the below formula:                  =LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"return the state abbreviation for: \"&B4)    ### Limitations:    *  **Returns long outputs** : At times, if you are not very specific with the LABS.GENERATIVEAI function, the output can be a full sentence instead of just what you need.  You can fix this by limiting the maximum output length or using the max_tokens argument of the function that we discuss later:    ![LABS.GENERATIVEAI function settings](    *  **Spilled array referencing constraint:** The function can’t [reference spilled arrays using the # operator]( so you need to reference each individual cell within the array.   *  **Can be unreliable when asked to return tables:** Even when specified in the prompt, at times, the output is a list instead of a table. So, it’s best to return the list and then use TEXTSPLIT and TRANSPOSE to return a table.  ##    ## Creating Content  While extracting lists of data from the web is one application, LABS.GENERATIVEAI can also create new content for you.  Let’s say, you are starting an online gadgets store. You want to list 100 products in the store, and you need a short description for each of them.  You can go ahead and write them yourself, or simply use LABS.GENERATIVEAI to do it for you. In fact, you can even scrape the product specifications from the web using this function.  Let’s find out how.  Create a 3-column table in Excel as shown below:    ![Create a 3 column table in Excel](    Add your product list in the Product Name column.  In the Description column, use the below formula to generate short descriptions:                  =LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"Return a short description for this product: \" &@[Product Name],0)    And in the Specs column, use the below formula to scrape specs from the web:                  =LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"Get the specs for the \" &@[Product Name],0)    And within seconds you will have a snazzy-looking table with products, descriptions, and specs.    ![table with product description and specifications](    ### Limitations:    *  **AI model can be outdated:** AI models are updated periodically, so AI output can lag real-time information. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S23 has been released, but the AI still considers them unreleased because the model precedes the product release date.   *  **AI output is not error-free** : As AI is still very new, some output might contain errors. It’s always a good practice to verify it after generation and clear out the errors.  ##    ## Analyzing Text  LABS.GENRATIVEAI can even conduct sentiment analysis of your text. For example, here I have some comments from one of my [videos]( on [BYCOL and BYROW functions]( Let’s analyze, and classify them into Positive, Negative and Neutral categories.  To do this, I will use the following formula:                  =LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"Use one word to summarise this text into positive, negative or neutral: \"&[@Comment])    ![sentiment analysis on text](    Within a few minutes, the function has completed the categorization. Now, I can get an idea of how people are reacting to my videos and create more videos to generate more positive comments.    ###  **Limitations:**    *  **Unreliable results:** If a comment has both positive and negative comments, the model might not be able to analyze it perfectly, as seen in cell B9.   *  **Time-Consuming:** The more data you want summarized, the more time the model takes to run.  However, even with all these limitations, LABS.GENERATIVEAI is a promising function for the future of Excel.  ##    ## Excel Formula Help  Point LABS.GENERATIVEAI at a formula and have it explain how it works, step- by-step:    ![Explaining how a formula works](    Use the [FORMULATEXT function]( to expose the underlying formula in the cell and add it to the prompt:                  =LABS.GENERATIVEAI(\"explain this formula step by step: \"&FORMULATEXT(D6))    ###  **Limitations:**    *  **Not always correct:** for example, point 1 above states that the table contains two columns, which isn’t true. The AI has assumed this because we only reference two columns in the formula, but the table actually contains 4 columns. While this isn’t going to cause any real issues, it’s a reminder that you can’t assume the AI is correct.   *  **Inconsistent results** : sometimes the AI is more thorough than other times. You may need to recalculate the formula until you get an explanation that’s adequate.  ##    ## How to get LABS.GENERATIVEAI in Excel  Go to Excel > Home Tab > Add-ins    ![Get Add- ins](    Get Add-ins > Search for Excel Labs > Press Add    ![Search for Excel Labs](    Once installed, you can access the Add-in from the Home Tab. It will open the sidebar on the right.  Scroll down to it > Press Open    ![Open Excel Labs add- in](    Generate an OpenAI API Key > Enter the key in the box.    ![Enter OpenAI key](    Once done, you can type in =LABS in any Excel cell, and you will see LABS.GENERATIVEAI function in the suggested formula list.  Also, make sure to optimize your settings.  ##    ## How to Optimize LABS.GENERATIVEAI Formula  The syntax for the function is LABS.GENERATIVEAI(prompt, [temperature], [max_tokens], [model])    *  **Prompt** is the only required argument in the function. It contains a description of what you want the generative AI model to return. It can be typed in double quotes or a reference to a cell containing the prompt, or a combination of both where the ampersand is used to concatenate the text and cell reference into a single prompt.   *  **Temperature** is an optional argument used to control the model randomness. Lower temperature means less randomness; higher temperature means more randomness. If you want the model output to not update every time you refresh the formula, set the Temperature to 0. **Note** : this does not guarantee it will always return the same result.   *  **Max_tokens** is also an optional argument that controls the output length. gpt-3.5-turbo offers 4097 tokens while gpt-4 offers 8192 tokens. One token is approximately 4 English characters. You can use the [OpenAI Tokens guide]( to find out how many tokens you need to specify in your formula.   *  **Model** is also an optional argument. It allows you to pick the model you want to run with your LABS.GENERATIVEAI command. gpt-4 is the latest release and is much more reliable compared to its predecessors.  You can pass specific values for these parameters in your function to get more accurate results.  ##    ## Tips and Best Practices  To get the desired results, you must follow the below best practices:    *  **Be precise:** The more accurate your prompt is the better results the function will render.   *  **Keep your prompts simple:** LABS.GENERATIVEAI returns better results when supplemented with other EXCEL functions, like we explained using TEXTSPLIT and TRANSPOSE, instead of asking it to return a table.   *  **Volatile:** The LABS.GENERATIVEAI formulas appear to be volatile, recalculating every time any other formulas on the sheet are edited or structural changes like inserting or deleting rows and columns are made. To avoid this, paste the output as values, or while writing the formulas put the workbook into Manual calculation mode:    ![Set  calculation mode to manual](     **WARNING** : Don’t forget to recalculate the workbook using the F9 key or by putting the workbook back into Automatic Calculation mode.    *  **Fund your account:** #N/A, #BUSY! errors can mean that you need to add funds to your OpenAI account at [ When co-authoring, all accounts should be funded otherwise the formula breaks.   *  **Daily token limits:** watch out for the daily limits on tokens as these can be easily reached and will also result in errors like #BUSY! that eventually returns #N/A!. Limits vary based on your plan. You can see them when logged into your OpenAI account in the Settings > Limits section.   **Tip** : if you reach your daily limit, try changing the model you’re using in the Excel Labs settings for LABS.GENERATIVEAI.    ## AI Is Everywhere  There are many ways you can leverage AI both inside and outside Excel.
